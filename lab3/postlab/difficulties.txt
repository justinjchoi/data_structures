1. I first attempted to create a whole new Stack class without using the LinkedList class from Lab 2. I thought this would be easier and a good way to review the material that we did in Lab 2. So, I created StackNode.h/cpp StackItr.h/cpp and Stack.h/cpp. However, when I was implementing Stack.cpp, I had trouble implementing the pop method. I realized that I did not have a Stack object created to perform methods such as remove (or pop, equivalent in Stack). Since I did not have a Stack object, I thought this implementation was not possible. I thought this would be easier since I originally thought I had to modify the LinkedList class since it is a doubly linked list. However, I was wrong. I just needed to use the methods from the linked list class to create a stack. So, I used the LinkedList class to implement the Stack class. 

2. Having a bunch of files was a bit confusing and made me to lose focus. Moving back and forth was a bit annoying, personally. So, I wonder if there could be any improvements later on for my CS career (not this course). I wonder if I could create an IDE that has a multi-view format which can support to open around 10 files at once so that I do not have to move back and forth.
