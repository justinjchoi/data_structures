Write at least one question about something in this program.

1. On the post lab page, it says we normally only include in .h files just the declarations (prototypes) of classes, constants, function, etc but not definitions of C++ methods. So, I was wondering what the difference is of a template class and classes we wrote and studied the past week. 

2. In the T* pop_head method, there is a line temp = temp -> next; I was wondering what the -> meant in terms of its operations.
