Question: Look at the output of lifecycle.cpp. Write at least one question about something in this program. Write your question in a text file. 

Answer: 

1. I was wondering what the reserved word "friend" in LifeCycle.h and "operator" meant in the C++ programming langauge

2. I was also wondering what rhs was in LifeCycle.cpp. What does rhs do in the constructor?
